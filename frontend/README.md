# Angular 17 example project: CRUD with Rest API

Build an Angular 17 CRUD example App to consume Rest APIs, display, modify & search data.

User Application in that:
- Each User has id, title, description, published status.
- We can create, retrieve, update, delete User.
- There is a Search bar for finding User by title.

Run `ng serve --port 8081` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8081/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
